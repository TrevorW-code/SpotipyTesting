# Spotify API Testing

Quick repo for testing the code from [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/extracting-song-data-from-the-spotify-api-using-python-b1e79388d50) article. Basically, first authenticate an "app" from spotify, store the creds and then run this python file. When do run it (in your cli), it will ask for a playlist url, send a request then return the target info from the first track of that playlist.
